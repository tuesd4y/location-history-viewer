# Google Location History Takeout Viewer

This application provides UI for viewing the GPS traces generated by google takeout with a 
Jetbrains compose frontend.

Creating the test file (small sample of the whole `Location History.json` file:)

```shell
jq '{locations: .locations[-1000:]}' < Location\ History/Location\ History.json > min_locations.json
```
