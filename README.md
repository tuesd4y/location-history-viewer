# Google Location History Takeout Viewer

This application provides a minimalistic UI for viewing the GPS traces generated by google takeout with a Jetbrains
compose frontend.

You first need to load a zip-file including a Google Location History takeout, which is then displayed as points on a
map in the second screen. Such a zip file can be downloaded from
the [google takeout service](https://takeout.google.com/)
(make sure to tick on `Location History`). A (small) example takeout file is also included in this repository at
[data/takeout-minimal.zip](data/takeout-minimal.zip).

The main focus of this application was to get to know the compose-desktop UI framework, and explore how utilising it in
combination with existing UI components that are built in Swing and AWT works.
